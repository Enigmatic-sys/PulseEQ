## 🚀 Key Features

* **12-Band Precision:** Optimized UI that fits a full 12-band rack on one screen—no scrolling required.
* **True Parametric Control:** Manually adjust **Frequency (Hz)** and **Q-Factor (Bandwidth)** for surgical audio editing.
* **iOS-Style Glassmorphism:** A borderless, "edge-to-edge" frosted glass interface with dynamic mesh gradients.
* **Intelligent Visual Feedback:** dB counters shift from **Cool Blue** to **Peak Red** as gain increases, providing a
    professional visual warning for digital clipping.
* **Custom Preset Engine:** Bass Max, Rock, Pop, Jazz, and Electronic. You can create your own preset.
* **User Profiles:** Save, name, and manage your own infinite library of sound signatures.
* **Privacy First:** No tracking, no data collection, no background scripts. Pure Web Audio API implementation.
